    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
     Passion is the drive that keeps me going. My inclination towards Mathematics has drawn me to pursue a degree in Actuarial Science. 
     The ability to apply mathematics and statistics in my working life in the future would allow me to continuously engage in situations 
     requiring analytical and problem-solving skills. 
     A degree in Actuarial Science will not only enable me to take the professional actuary examinations and head on to careers involving insurance,
     but also allows me to venture into different job prospectus such as finance and investments, risk management, social policy, education and research.
    I am a restless person, restless in a sense that I do not enjoy doing robotic jobs over and over again for years.
    A risk can be defined as an action taken despite uncertainty. I believe there is an element of uncertainty in every decision we make. 
    From decisions as trivial as having tea or coffee in the morning to those as important as deciding what course to study at university.
    Whilst we remain unable to determine the future, uncertainty and risk will continue to exist and continue to make our ability to make decisions difficult. 
    The ability to quantify risk is a desirable one and something that makes the actuarial profession an attractive option for me. My main reason for wanting to
    study actuarial science is to prepare me for a career as an actuary. Having researched routes into the profession, it was clear that doing an actuarial science 
    degree was the best route for me.
